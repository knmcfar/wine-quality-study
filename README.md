# Analysis of Wine Quality Using Forward Stepwise Selection 

This report was created by a small group for BIOST 544: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science to classify wine as high or low quality using forward stepwise selection and comparing results using AIC and BIC as selection criterion. A training and test set were utilized to calculate the misclassification error rate and compare models.

# Contents

The report, presentation slides, code, and dataset (the csv file titled winequality-red) are uploaded to this repository. If the dataset is saved to the same directory that the working directory is set to, the dataset can be imported to R directly using the code.

# Lessons Learned

Through this project, I was able to gain experience with machine learning models and best practices for utilizing a training and test set, as well as how best to report these results in a well-organized presentation.
